# CONTRIBUTORS Guide

## How to Get Started?

The easiest way to start contributing is to look through the **open issues** in the repository. You can filter issues with the label **[Good First Issue](https://github.com/Raghul-M/DevOps-Hub/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)** — these are relatively self-contained issues, perfect for first-time contributors.

Once you’ve identified an issue, please comment on it to let the maintainers know you’re working on it!

If you'd like to suggest a **new feature** or make an improvement, feel free to **raise a new issue** by clicking on the [New Issue](https://github.com/Raghul-M/DevOps-Hub/issues/new) button. Engage with the maintainers to discuss the feature before proceeding.

## Steps to Submit Your Changes

1. **Fork the repository**: Create your own copy of the project by clicking the **Fork** button at the top right of the repository page.
2. **Create a new branch** for your changes:
   - If you're working on an existing issue, name your branch as `issue_<issue_id>`, so we can track the changes back to the issue.
   - For example: `issue_123`.
3. **Make your changes** locally, and commit your work:
   - Keep your commits focused, and write clear, concise commit messages.
4. **Open a Pull Request (PR)**:
   - After pushing your changes to your fork, go to the original repository and create a **PR**. You can compare your branch against the `main` branch of the repository.

## General Guidelines for Contributions:

- **Code of Conduct**: Be respectful and considerate when interacting with other contributors. We're here to build a helpful, inclusive community.
- **Documentation**: If you're making code changes, don't forget to update the documentation if necessary. A well-documented project is easier to maintain and use.
- **Commit Messages**: Write descriptive commit messages. A good commit message should explain the "why" behind the change, not just the "what".
- **Pull Request Reviews**: When you open a PR, the maintainers will review your code. If there are any issues or feedback, they will provide comments for you to address. Once the changes are approved, your PR will be merged.

## Additional Notes

- **Review Process**: After your PR is submitted, the maintainer will review it. If everything looks good, it will be merged, and your contribution will be accepted.
- **Engagement**: We encourage contributors to engage with the maintainers, ask questions, and participate in discussions regarding issues or new features.
